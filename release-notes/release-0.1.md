# EOEPCA System - Release 0.1

## Functionality

Release 0.1 is designed to satisfy the following use case...

1. User login in accordance with Epic EOEPCA-1 (User Login)
   * See EOEPCA-1 for elaboration of capabilities to be demonstrated

1. User obtains auth token (bearer) for platform access via CLI

1. User must be authenticated to access ADES endpoints
   * implies PEP<br>
   _This initial version of the PEP will register the whole ADES as a UMA Resource, therefore intercepting ANY request and enforcing authentication (assuming not enough time to include any specific authorisation)_

1. ADES is protected by a PEP that supports auth tokens obtained through User Login

1. User discovers available applications:
   * at the application catalogue (provided temporarily by Terradue Catalogue)
   * at the ADES via WPS (GetCapabilties)
   * at the ADES via OGC API Processes (REST/JSON)

1. User obtains details for a specific process from the ADES:
   * at the ADES via WPS (DescribeProcess)
   * at the ADES via OGC API Processes (REST/JSON)

1. Basic resource catalogue providing discovery of dataset inputs for processing

1. User invokes execution of an existing process at the ADES:
   * at the ADES via WPS (ExecuteProcess)
   * at the ADES via OGC API Process (REST/JSON)
   * specifies input data and parameterisation

1. User monitors process execution
   * at the ADES via WPS (GetStatus)
   * at the ADES via OGC API Process (REST/JSON)
   * User obtains outcome and downloads results
   * (would be nice if this was limited to the invoking user)

1. User deploys their own containerised application at the ADES
   * at the ADES via WPS (Execute + DeployProcess Service)

1. User undeploys their containerised application at the ADES
   * at the ADES via WPS (Execute + UndeployProcess Service)
