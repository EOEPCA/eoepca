<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Here's a blank template to get started:
**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`template-svce`, `twitter_handle`, `email`

### Built With

* [Terraform](https://terraform.io/)
* [Ansible](https://ansible.com)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)
* [Docker](https://docker.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) 
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

### Installation

*Local environment*

It creates a testing environment in a Minikube cluster deployed on the local machine  
1. `cd terraform/test`
2. Define needed environment variables:
- `export DOCKER_EMAIL=[Email of te account with access to the Dockerhub EOEPCA repository`
- `export DOCKER_USERNAME=[User name of te account with access to the Dockerhub EOEPCA repository`
- `export DOCKER_PASSWORD=[Password of te account with access to the Dockerhub EOEPCA repository`
3. `./deployEOEPCA.sh`

This will create a system accesible from local node at https://test.eoepca.org


*Staging environment*

It creates a testing environment on an Openstack environment provided by a Network-of-Resources provider (e.g. a DIAS platform)
1. [Register yourself into openstack provider and obtain cloud.key for access]
2. [Obtain detailed credential for accessing the environment and modify terraform/staging/openrc.sh with this information]
3. `cd terraform/staging`
4. `source openrc.sh` [You may be asked for the password if not already set]
5. `./setupOpenstack.sh --apply` [or --destroy to remove]
6. `./setupKubernetes.sh`
- You would be asked of VAULT_PASSWORD environment variable. Ask your EOEPCA admin if you don't have it.

Once you have the underlying openstack/kubernetes environment, you can proceed to deploy the EOEPCA system itself. Use this call:

7. `./deployEOEPCA.sh`

This will deploy an EOEPCA system reachable over the internet at https://staging.eoepca.org

### Testing

Once installed, developers can deploy environments for these pipelines:
- local test: executing `sh travis/test_template-service.sh` will create the test environment, deploy a sample service and perform simple acceptance tests on that service.

- [TODO] remote integration: executing `sh travis/stage_template-service.sh` will create the staging environment, deploy a sample service and perform simple acceptance tests on that service.

You would see a result similar to this:
`Tuesday 14 April 2020  12:18:45 +0000 (0:00:02.246)       0:03:01.552 ********* 
ok: [45.130.30.38] => {
  "test_result.stdout_lines": [
    "Testing connectivity with the infrastructure",
    "MiniKube Master IP is 172.16.0.2:6443",
    "Testing connectivity with the services",
    "Cluster IP of frontend is 45.130.30.36:8081",
    "{",
      "  \"result\": \"search results\"",
    "}",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK",
    "Server: nginx/1.7.9",
    "Date: Tue, 14 Apr 2020 12:21:40 GMT",
    "Content-Type: application/json",
    "Content-Length: 27",
    "Connection: keep-alive",
    "",
    "{\"result\":\"search results\"}"
  ]
}`

Notice the Cluster IP of frontend. You may also test the API entrypoint yourself with:
  `curl http://[FRONTEND_IP]:[PORT]/search`
