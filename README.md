<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

EO Exploitation Platform Common Architecture (EOEPCA)

The goal of the “Common Architecture” is to define and agree the technical interfaces for the future exploitation of Earth Observation data in a distributed environment. The Common Architecture will thus provide the interfaces to facilitate the federation of different EO resources into a “Network of EO Resources”. The “Common Architecture” will be defined using open interfaces that link the different resources (building blocks) so that a user can efficiently access and consume the disparate services of the “Network of EO Resources”.

This repository represents the system integration of the building block that comprise the **Reference Implementation** of the Common Architecture.

The system is designed for deployment to cloud infrastructure orchestrated by a Kubernetes cluster. We include here the automation required to provision, deploy and test the emerging EOEPCA system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The EOEPCA system deployment comprises several steps. Instructions are provided for both cloud deployment, and local deployment for development purposes.

The first step is to fork this repository into your GitHub account. Use of fork (rather than clone) is recommended to support our GitOps approach to deployment with Flux Continuous Delivery, which requires write access to your git repository for deployment configurations.<br>
Having forked, clone the repository to your local platform...
```
$ git clone git@github.com:<user>/eoepca.git
$ cd eoepca
$ git checkout v0.3
```
NOTE that this clones the specific tag that is well tested. The `develop` branch should alternatively be used for the latest development.

Step | Cloud (OpenStack) | Local Developer
-----|-------------------|----------------
Infrastructure | [CREODIAS](./creodias/README.md) | n/a *(local developer platform)*
Kubernetes Cluster | [Rancher Kubernetes Engine](./kubernetes/README.md) | [Minikube](./minikube/README.md)
EOEPCA System Deployment | [EOEPCA GitOps](./system/README.md) | [EOEPCA GitOps](./system/README.md)
Acceptance Test | [Run Test Suite](./test/acceptance/README.md) | [Run Test Suite](./test/acceptance/README.md)

### Hostnames and DNS

To ease development/testing, the EOEPCA deployment is configured to use host/service names that embed IP-addresses - which avoids the need to configure public nameservers, (as would be necessary for a production deployment). Our services are exposed through Kubernetes ingress rules that use name-based routing, and so simple IP-addresses are insufficient. Therefore, we exploit the services of [nip.io](https://nip.io/) that provides dynamic DNS in which the hostname->IP-adress mapping is embedded in the hostname.

Thus, we use host/service names of the form `<service-name>.<public-ip>.nip.io`, where the `<public-ip>` is the public-facing IP-address of the deployment. For cloud deployment the public IP is that of the cloud load-balancer, or for minikube it is the `minikube ip` - for example `workspace.192.168.49.2.nip.io`.

The deployment scripts (linked in the above table) attempt to intelligently determine the public IP and so configure the service DNS names without intervention. For example, the output of CREODIAS infrastructure setup is interrogated to determine the IP-address of the public cloud load-balancer, which is then injected into the deployment configuration. Similarly for a local developer setup in which the 'local' kubernetes IP-address is used (deduced as the IP address of the k8s node (assumed single node)).

NOTE that, with release v0.3, the number of system components has been expanded to the point where it is more difficult to make a full system deployment in minikube, due to the required resource demands.
