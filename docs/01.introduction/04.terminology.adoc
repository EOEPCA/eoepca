| Analysis Result
| The _Products_ produced as output of an _Interactive Application_ analysis session.

| Analytics
| A set of activities aimed to discover, interpret and communicate meaningful patters within the data. Analytics considered here are performed manually (or in a semi-automatic way) on-line with the aid of _Interactive Applications_.

| Application Artefact
| The 'software' component that provides the execution unit of the _Application Package_.

| Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES)
| WPS-T (REST/JSON) service that incorporates the Docker execution engine, and is responsible for the execution of the processing service (as a WPS request) within the ‘target’ Exploitation Platform.

| Application Descriptor
| A file that provides the metadata part of the _Application Package_. Provides all the metadata required to accommodate the processor within the WPS service and make it available for execution.

| Application Package
| A platform independent and self-contained representation of a software item, providing executable, metadata and dependencies such that it can be deployed to and executed within an Exploitation Platform. Comprises the _Application Descriptor_ and the _Application Artefact_.

| Bulk Processing
| Execution of a _Processing Service_ on large amounts of data specified by AOI and TOI.

| Code
| The codification of an algorithm performed with a given programming language - compiled to Software or directly executed (interpretted) within the platform.

| Compute Platform

| Guest
| An unregistered User or an unauthenticated Consumer with limited access to the EP's services

| Home Platform
| The Platform on which a User is based or from which an action was initiated by a User

| Host Platform
| The Platform through which a Resource has been published

| Identity Provider (IdP)
| The source for validating user identity in a federated identity system, (user authentication as a service).

| Interactive Application
| A stand-alone application provided within the exploitation platform for on-line hosted processing. Provides an interactive interface through which the user is able to conduct their analysis of the data, producing _Analysis Results_ as output. Interactive Applications include at least the following types: console application, web application (rich browser interface), remote desktop to a hosted VM.

| Interactive Console Application
| A simple _Interactive Application_ for analysis in which a console interface to a platform-hosted terminal is provided to the user. The console interface can be provided through the user's browser session or through a remote SSH connection.

| Interactive Remote Desktop
| An Interactive Application for analysis provided as a remote desktop session to an OS-session (or directly to a 'native' application) on the exploitation platform. The user will have access to a number of applications within the hosted OS. The remote desktop session is provided through the user’s web browser.

| Interactive Web Application
| An Interactive Application for analysis provided as a rich user interface through the user's web browser.

| Key-Value Pair
| A key-value pair (KVP) is an abstract data type that includes a group of key identifiers and a set of associated values. Key-value pairs are frequently used in lookup tables, hash tables and configuration files.

| Kubernetes (K8s)
| Container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling and management.

| Login Service
| An encapsulation of Authenticated Login provision within the Exploitation Platform context. The Login Service is an OpenID Connect Provider that is used purely for authentication. It acts as a Relying Party in flows with external IdPs to obtain access to the user's identity.

| EO Network of Resources
| The coordinated collection of European EO resources (platforms, data sources, etc.).

| Object Store
| A computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects. Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier.

| On-demand Processing Service
| A _Processing Service_ whose execution is initiated directly by the user on an ad-hoc basis.

| Platform (EP)
| An on-line collection of products, services and tools for exploitation of EO data

| Platform Tier
| The Platform Tier represents the Exploitation Platform and the services it offers to end-users

| Processing
| A set of pre-defined activities that interact to achieve a result. For the exploitation platform, comprises on-line processing to derive data products from input data, conducted by a hosted processing service execution.

| Processing Result
| The _Products_ produced as output of a _Processing Service_ execution.

| Processing Service
| A non-interactive data processing that has a well-defined set of input data types, input parameterisation, producing _Processing Results_ with a well-defined output data type.

| Products
| EO data (commercial and non-commercial) and Value-added products and made available through the EP. _It is assumed that the Hosting Environment for the EP makes available an existing supply of EO Data_

| Resource
| A entity, such as a Product, Processing Service or Interactive Application, which is of interest to a user, is indexed in a catalogue and can be returned as a single meaningful search result

| Reusable Research Object
| An encapsulation of some research/analysis that describes all aspects required to reproduce the analysis, including data used, processing performed etc.

| Scientific Researcher
| Expert user with the objective to perform scientific research. Having minimal IT knowledge with no desire to acquire it, they want the effort for the translation of their algorithm into a service/product to be minimised by the platform.

| Service Developer
| Expert user with the objective to provide a performing, stable and reliable service/product. Having deeper IT knowledge or a willingness to acquire it, they require deeper access to the platform IT functionalities for optimisation of their algorithm.

| Software
| The compilation of code into a binary program to be executed within the platform on-line computing environment.

| Systematic Processing Service
| A _Processing Service_ whose execution is initiated automatically (on behalf of a user), either according to a schedule (routine) or triggered by an event (e.g. arrival of new data).

| Terms & Conditions (T&Cs)
| The obligations that the user agrees to abide by in regard of usage of products/services of the platform. T&Cs are set by the provider of each product/service.
